<p><strong>Accessing the <em>R</em> Documentation</strong></p>
<p>Many functions in <em>R</em> require several arguments, and it is impossible to remember how all functions are used correctly. Thankfully, it is not necessary to know how each function is used by heart. R Studio makes it easy for us to access the <em>R</em> documentation, where every function has a detailed description page.</p>
<p>There are two ways to search for a function documentation page. The first is to access the <strong>Help</strong> pane in the lower left corner of R Studio, and then use the search bar to find information on a specific function. A more convenient way is to simply run <code>?</code> followed by the name of the function in the console, e.g.Â <code>?mean</code>. This will open the documentation entry for this function automatically.</p>
<p>The <em>R</em> documentation of a function usually at least contains a <strong>Usage</strong>, <strong>Arguments</strong> and <strong>Examples</strong> section. The <strong>Arguments</strong> and <strong>Examples</strong> section is often particularly helpful to understand how a function is used.</p>
