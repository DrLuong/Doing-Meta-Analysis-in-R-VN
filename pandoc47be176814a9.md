**Accessing the _R_ Documentation**

\vspace{2mm}

Many functions in _R_ require several arguments, and it is impossible to remember how all functions are used correctly. Thankfully, it is not necessary to know how each function is used by heart. R Studio makes it easy for us to access the _R_ documentation, where every function has a detailed description page. 

There are two ways to search for a function documentation page. The first is to access the **Help** pane in the lower left corner of R Studio, and then use the search bar to find information on a specific function. A more convenient way is to simply run `?` followed by the name of the function in the console, e.g. `?mean`. This will open the documentation entry for this function automatically. 


The _R_ documentation of a function usually at least contains a **Usage**, **Arguments** and **Examples** section. The **Arguments** and **Examples** section is often particularly helpful to understand how a function is used.
